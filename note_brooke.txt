data cleaning
 - combine movies with duplicate titles but different ids in this dataset and report those movies in log
   - 18 out of 1681 movies are shown in data twice
 - remove movies do not have reviews and report those movies in log
 - store cleaned movie (and data) in both txt and python-readable formats


basic visualization
 - store all ratings and visualize (histogram or any other proper methods)
 - calculate average rating and number of ratings for each movie
   - histogram of average rating
   - histogram of number of ratings
   - use a boxplot to understand where the quantiles of top-10 fall in the data.
 - [rating histogram] of 10 most popular movies
 - [rating histogram] of 10 best movies
   - discussion: setting a lower threshold on how many ratings the movie got? 
 - filter out data of movies of three selected genres and create a rating histogram for each genre


Matrix Factorization: learn matrices U and V s.t. Y ~ U^T V (at least three methods)
 - HW5
   - choose k = 20
 - Incorporate bias terms a and b for each user and movie (own implementation, not code from elsewhere) 
   - choose k = 20
 - Use an off-the-shelf implementation 
   - (such as Surprise SVD) google ”collaborative filtering” for more info
 - for all methods: 
   - split the MovieLens dataset into a training set (of size 90,000) and a test set (of size 10,000), as given in the files train.txt and test.txt
   - compare these methods by assessing their performance on the test set.

Visualization
 - project U, V into a 2D space: apply SVD to V = A Sigma B and use the first two columns of A 
 - visualize the new V [movie selection: (a)-(d)]
